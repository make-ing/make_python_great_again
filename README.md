# Make Python Great Again

# Description

After seeing a tweet about [this](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf) study, which tells that python has a very bad CO2 emmsion rate compared to other languages, and after listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URrUBgOFl6U) podcast. I had this idea in mind that if we could improve an applications/libraries performance just a tiny bit, this could have a very large absolute impact on the CO2 emissions if this app/lib is used heavily around the world.
